    <h1>The Importance of Accessibility on the Web</h1>
    <p id="p1">
      The accessibility of websites is extremely important. Almost one in five
      people in the United States have some form of disability, that is 20% of
      the country. When you choose to not factor in accessibility issues that
      people can have while using your website, you can literally lose 20% of
      the business that you could have had if you chose to address these issues.
      A good reference for building a website while addressing accessibility
      issues for people with disabilities can be found at
      <a href="https://www.echalk.com/website-accessibility-challenges"
        >eChalk</a
      >. As you navigate through my website you will learn common disabilities
      that people have that cause accessibility issues, and ways to confront
      these issues.
