        Cognitive impairment might be the most prevalent out of all the
        impairments. I myself have a cognitive impairment called ADHD, which can
        make task that a neurotypical brain makes look easy, actually be very
        difficult for myself. There are many other cognitive impairments that
        people struggle with that you want to make sure that you do not forget
        about while building your website, like autism, dyslexia, dyscalculia,
        dysgraphia, and many more. The main fix for this for building your web
        site is done by one word, the word is <i>easy</i>. You want everything
        on your web site to be easy. You want your layout to be easy, as to
        where people with cognitive issues do not need to search to find things
        that should be in a certain area, like a navigation bar should be placed
        at the top of your page and not the middle of the page. Also, you want
        to use words that are easily understood, and not big, long words that
        people do not use in daily life, like if you were writing a medical page
        for users, you would not want to use the word <i>cephalalgia</i>, you
        would use the word <i>headache</i> instead. The video to the left of
        this text is a video I like to have people watch to learn about what I
        have, because there are many stereotypes out there about people with
        ADHD that is not true.
