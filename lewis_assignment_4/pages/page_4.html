        Dexterity is a major impairment issue with a huge variance of severity.
        These types of impairments could be from an accident, from old age, from
        a disease that surfaces on someone, or even from just being born with
        it. It could be someone with shaky hands, no grip, no control of their
        hand muscles, or even someone without hands. These people cannot be left
        out when it comes to using computers, and the internet. One thing that
        you want to make sure is that someone is able to use keyboard functions
        to use your web site. This is because some people have a very difficult
        time using a mouse, so they will use functions on the keyboard like the
        arrow buttons to maneuver around the page, or the tab button to go left
        and right on the navigation bar to choose which page they would like to
        go on. You also want to use good headers, and good menu organization
        also to make it easier for the users to know where they need to go. The
        video I have here to the right of this text is a very touching story of
        this child, and how she uses a computer to be able to talk to people,
        because she is not able to speak herself. This shows the very importance
        of people of all disabilities needing to be able to utilize a computer
        properly, someone like this needs a computer to even communicate with
        someone.
