        There is an extreme amount of people in the United States that have a
        vision disability. There are people of all ages from young to old, and
        from minor vision problems to people that are completely blind. The main
        image above shows someone reading braille. To the right of this content
        is a very good video about early intervention of very young children
        with visual problems. If the users who navigate your website can't read
        your content then it really means nothing to them, and they will not
        stay on your website. Some things that you need to take into
        consideration is the size of your font; it needs to be big enough to be
        read by someone without great vision. You also need to consider a font
        that is good on the eyes to read, like a sans-serif type. You also need
        to make sure that all your images have an alt attribute stating what is
        in the image, so their image reader can read to them what they are not
        able to see. You also need to have good contrast between the background
        color and your font color to be able to see it clear, you can't have a
        dark background with dark font, and you can't have a light background
        with a light font.
