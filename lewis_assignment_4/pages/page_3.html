        Just like with vision problems, there is an extreme amount of people in
        the United States with hearing impairments. If you do not consider the
        hearing impaired population of the users visiting your site, you could
        also lose a significant number of customers for your business. Although
        using a computer is a little less of a struggle for somebody that is
        hearing impaired, there are still some struggles that you need to
        address on your web site. There are two main items to address for
        someone with a hearing impairment. The first item to address is to make
        sure that all your videos have closed captions available, this way
        someone with a hearing impairment can still follow along with your
        videos. The second item would have to do with podcast, or similar audio
        items, you will want to have a transcript, so the users with hearing
        impairments can utilize your audio items by reading the text of them. I
        have included a very educational video to the left of this text that
        educates you about keeping hearing impaired children involved in the
        classroom by making sure they are able to hear the entire conversations
        between teachers and students during classroom time.
